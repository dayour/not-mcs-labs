   - **Sales policy document**: A Word document containing sales policies, procedures, and guidelines

3. **Download** the **Excel file** to a memorable location.  Open downloaded the file and note the data structure:
   - Ensure it contains sales data across multiple quarters/years
   - Verify product line categorization

> [!TIP]
>  Check the document sensitivity while the Excel file is open and ensure it's set appropriately.

4. Open the **Word policy document** and review:

2. On the side pane, expand **Agents** and select **Create agent**.

3. When prompted to **describe the agent**, use this specific prompt:

```
You are a Sales Admin Assistant. Your job is to help sales managers track revenue and identify trends across product lines. You understand product hierarchies, time periods (e.g. quarters, fiscal years), and sales metrics. Users can ask questions like 'Graph the sales for the last 2 years with a breakdown per product line and quarter'. You always respond in a friendly and professional tone, aiming to be helpful and insightful.
```

4. **Confirm** the suggested agent name when prompted.

Commented out; screenshots need update due to CPS updates.  Last minute change to labs required so will do at a later date
> [!TIP]
> If you can't see the files you just opened, an alternative approach is just to **paste** and **add** the SharePoint URL of the Sales folder.
>

#### Test code interpreter with data analysis

4. **Start a new chat** and test the **code interpreter** capability with a data analysis request:

```
Analyze sales data for the last 2 years with a breakdown per product line and quarter. Use data from Sales.xlsx.
```

5. When offered to get a visual chart of this breakdown, **confirm**.
