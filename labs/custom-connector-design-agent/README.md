## ü§î Why This Matters

**Working with creative teams or marketing?** You know the pain of spending hours searching for the perfect image, only to settle for generic stock photos that don't capture your vision. Custom connectors in Copilot Studio change everything!

Think of building a Design Agent like hiring a creative assistant:
- **Without a Design Agent**: Teams waste time browsing through hundreds of irrelevant images, struggle to find consistent visual themes, and make design decisions without professional guidance
- **With a Design Agent**: Users get instant access to curated Getty Images content with AI-powered recommendations, thematic suggestions, and intelligent design guidance based on industry best practices

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**
- "Our team spends too much time searching for appropriate imagery for campaigns"
- "We need professional-quality images but don't know how to find them efficiently"
- "Our design choices lack consistency and professional guidance"
- "We want to integrate high-quality image search into our creative workflow"

**The 45 minutes you invest in this lab will revolutionize how your team approaches visual content creation!**

---

## üåê Introduction

Modern creative workflows demand immediate access to professional-quality imagery with intelligent search capabilities. This lab guides you through creating a sophisticated Design Agent that not only searches Getty Images through a custom REST connector but also provides intelligent design recommendations, color palette suggestions, and creative guidance.

**Real-world scenario:** Imagine a marketing team member asks: "I need heroic lifestyle images of remote workers for our productivity campaign, preferably with warm color tones and diverse representation." Your Design Agent will:
1. Search Getty Images using optimized query parameters
2. Filter results based on visual characteristics (color, mood, composition)
3. Analyze image metadata for diversity and representation
4. Provide design rationale and usage recommendations
5. Suggest complementary images for campaign consistency

This level of creative intelligence transforms time-consuming image searches into strategic design conversations, elevating both efficiency and creative output quality.

   - "I need images for"
   - "Find me photos of"
   - "Show me visuals for"
   - "Search for imagery"
   - "Help me find pictures"

6. In the topic authoring canvas, add a **Question** node:
   - **Question**: "I'd love to help you find the perfect imagery! Can you describe your creative vision? Include details like mood, style, subjects, colors, or any specific requirements."
   - **Save response to**: `CreativeBrief` (Text variable)

7. Add a **Generative answers** node and configure it:
   - **Data source**: Getty Images Search tool
   - **Content moderation**: Strict
   - **Custom system message**:
     ```
     Based on the user's creative brief, search for professional imagery that matches their vision. 
     
     Use these guidelines for search optimization:
     - Extract key visual elements and mood descriptors
     - Use specific, descriptive search terms
     - Consider orientation, number of people, and composition needs
     - Prioritize the most relevant and highest quality results
     
     Present results with:
     - Brief description of why each image fits their brief
     - Design rationale and usage suggestions
     - Alternative search directions if needed
     
     Always maintain a professional, creative tone while being helpful and insightful.
     ```

   - **Options**: 
     - "Refine current search"
     - "Find similar images"
     - "Try different direction"
     - "These look perfect"

9. For each option, create appropriate follow-up actions:
   - **Refine**: Ask for specific adjustments (colors, mood, composition)
   - **Similar**: Use the same search with variation parameters
   - **Different**: Start a new creative exploration
   - **Perfect**: Provide usage and licensing guidance

#### Test the Complete Workflow

10. In the **Test your agent** panel, try these comprehensive test scenarios:

    **Test 1 - Marketing Campaign:**
    ```
    I need heroic lifestyle images of remote workers for our productivity campaign, preferably with warm color tones and diverse representation.
    ```

    **Test 2 - Website Header:**
    ```
    Find me a horizontal header image for our tech startup's website - something modern, energetic, showing collaboration but not too busy.
    ```

    **Test 3 - Social Media:**
    ```
    I need square format images for Instagram - professional but approachable, showing customers using our product in real-world settings.

    - **Content filtering**: Medium (appropriate for professional creative content)
    - **Fallback behavior**: Provide alternative search suggestions

13. Test the refined configuration with various creative briefs to ensure consistent, professional responses.

#### Validate End-to-End Creative Workflow

14. Conduct a final comprehensive test with this realistic scenario:

    ```
    Our company is launching a new wellness app and needs imagery for our website hero section, social media campaign, and email marketing. The brand feeling should be calm, inclusive, and aspirational - think people finding balance in their daily lives. We need both individual portraits and lifestyle scenes, with a preference for natural lighting and authentic moments rather than overly posed shots.
    ```

15. Verify that your agent:
    - Understands the multi-faceted creative brief
    - Provides relevant Getty Images search results
    - Offers professional design guidance
    - Suggests complementary images for campaign consistency
